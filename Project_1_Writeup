**Finding Lane Lines on Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect

### Pipeline Description
Steps to create lane lines are as shown:
3 main steps:
1. before Hough
    a. takes image and creates a grayscale version
    b. adding blur
    c. applying canny vision
    d. applying region of interest mask

2. Hough transform + lines creation
    a. takes the result/output from the 1 step
    b. using the helper funciton hough_lines to draw lines
    
3. after Hough
    a. takes the result/output from step 2
    b. Identify and separates lines from left and right side of lane through slope threshold (0.5 and -0.5)
    c. calculates an average intercept and slope
    d. draws a straight line for left and right lane line respectively
    

###Potential Shortcomings
1. Because the algorithm extrapolates regardless of relationship between frames, the lines could change drastically from one frame to another
2. Because of the fixed slope threshold, the algorithm would have trouble identifying lanes at atypical angles

###Potential Improvements
1. Add in logic to identify outliers for slopes detected between frames (so lines do not vary wildly from frame to frame)
2. Add in an algorithm to alter/change the slope threshold depending on the circumstances
